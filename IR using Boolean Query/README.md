# Python code for implementing Information Retrieval using Boolean Query

- I've used boolean queries to retrieve the most important documents from all documents in the data set. The extracted documents will fulfill the userâ€™s request by retrieving information on the basis of semantic nature of the query.
- Linkedlist is used in this approach as it occupies less space because it links and processes only those files which contain the word, rather than processing all the files of the dataset.

## Overview of the Approach used :
